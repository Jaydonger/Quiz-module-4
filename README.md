# Quiz-module-4
description

This is a timed quiz consisting of three questions. Your score is based on time left and questions answered correctly. If you answer a question incorrectly, time will be removed from the clock. The quiz will end when either the timer reaches '0' or you have answered all the questions. You will then be able to enter your initials and submit your score to the leaderboard. You may also clear the leaderboard by clicking on the 'Clear Highscores' button. You are allowed to view these highscores before starting (but not during) the quiz with the 'View highscores' button.
